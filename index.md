# Oh, hi there

## Where?

You can currently find me in [Berlin, Germany](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.518611&mlon=13.408333&zoom=12#map=12/52.5186/13.4083&layers=T).

## What? 

At the moment I'm working at [Byrd](https://getbyrd.com/), delivering world-class fulfillment experience to the long tail of shops.

## How?

I am an all-around engineer spending most of my time with various web technologies and tools.

This time I play with:

* Python, Flask
* Heroku, AWS
* PostgreSQL, Redis

In my free time I connect stuff to Raspberry Pi Zero and various ESP8226 / ESP32 boards. All powered by MicroPython.

And that's a lot of fun.
