# Oh, hi there

## Where?

You can currently find me in [Berlin, Germany](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.518611&mlon=13.408333&zoom=12#map=12/52.5186/13.4083&layers=T).

## What? 

At the moment I'm working at [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/), helping plant the trees.

## How?

I am an all-around engineer spending most of my time with various web technologies and tools.

This time I play with:

* JavaScript (duh!) sometimes even ES6, both browser and Node
* Python, Django, Pandas
* Chrome extension and Firefox add-on SDKs

And that's a lot of fun.

# What else?

Well, you can grok my [Github](https://github.com/odiroot) profile. Or my [old blog](http://blog.odnous.net/).
